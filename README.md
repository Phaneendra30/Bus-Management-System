The Bus Management System is a console-based application developed in C language that manages bus information efficiently. The system allows users to view available buses, add new bus details, and persist data using file handling.

Each bus record contains details such as bus name, bus number, source, destination, departure and arrival times, maximum seats, and passenger count. The project uses structures for organized data storage and modular programming for better code readability.

The application implements a menu-driven interface for ease of use and ensures data persistence by saving records to a text file (busdetails.txt) and loading them automatically at startup.

This project is an excellent example of structured programming, file I/O, and real-world data management, and it provides hands-on experience in building C-based management systems similar to small-scale transport or reservation systems.

Key Highlights:

Dynamic addition of bus records

Persistent storage using files

Easy-to-use menu interface

Practical implementation of C structures and functions
